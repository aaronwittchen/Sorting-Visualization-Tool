# Sorting Visualization Tool - TODO

## Core Functionality

- [ ] Add more sorting algorithms: Heap Sort, Shell Sort, Counting Sort, Tim Sort, Cocktail Sort
- [ ] Enhanced visualization: different styles (bars/circles/numbers), color themes, continuous speed control, step-by-step mode
- [ ] Data input options: custom arrays, different distributions, variable size (10-200), file import
- [ ] Algorithm comparison: side-by-side view, performance metrics, real-time graphs

## UI/UX Improvements

- [ ] Mobile-optimized responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility: screen reader support, keyboard navigation, high contrast
- [ ] Settings panel with user preferences storage
- [ ] History and favorites system

## Technical

- [ ] Performance optimization: virtual scrolling, Web Workers, WebGL rendering
- [ ] Code quality: TypeScript migration, component extraction, better testing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
- [ ] Backend integration for user accounts

## Educational Features

- [ ] Interactive tutorials and step-by-step explanation
- [ ] Quiz mode and algorithm building
- [ ] Pseudocode display
- [ ] Video tutorials and documentation

## Advanced Features

- [ ] Multi-language support (i18n)
- [ ] Social features: sharing, community challenges
- [ ] External integrations: GitHub, educational platforms
- [ ] Parallel and distributed sorting algorithms

## Bug Fixes

- [ ] Large array performance issues
- [ ] Safari compatibility
- [ ] Memory leaks in long-running visualizations
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Add build status badge to READM
  - If using GitHub Actions for testing/CI, include theworkflow badge
  - Add Codecov coverage badge for test coverage reports

## Completed

- [x] 7 sorting algorithms implementation
- [x] Real-time visualization with start/pause/resume
- [x] Speed control and state persistence
- [x] Algorithm information modal
- [x] Responsive design and comprehensive testing
- [x] React 18, Tailwind CSS, Context API setup
